> The first rule of code club is don't talk about lines of code

My impression is that nearly everyone running a software team wishes they could have more people.
“We’re doing our best with the undersized team that we have” is a common catch-cry. And certainly
I've been on teams where it feels like we could productively spend all of our available time just
keeping the lights on – bugfixes, performance, and minor incremental improvements rather than
anything revolutionary.

Metrics are notoriously hard to determine in software development. Do you have enough people for the
task at hand?

I have a team of 3-4 engineers looking after about 170k lines of code. Is this normal? It's
certainly a struggle to introduce new features at the rate the business would like, and we could
spend a lot more time just keeping the codebase tidy.

So I thought I'd do a quick survey to see how it compares to other projects, and see if there were
many correlations.

## The first rule of Fight Club

Talking about lines of code is surprisingly polarising. Yes, judging productivity or value created
created by lines of code has long been written off as doing much more harm than good. But, it's a m

To be honest, I'm 50/50 on whether any meaningful. But what surprised me was number of people
suggesting it's pointless or _dangerous_ to even ask the question.
