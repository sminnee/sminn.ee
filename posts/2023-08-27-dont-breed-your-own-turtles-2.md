title: Don’t breed your own turtles

In both projects, I started out with a strong desired to avoid the complicated 'stack of turtles'
that so often plagues web projects. To this end, rather than pull in a bunch of libraries that do
things out of the box, but increase the complexity of the solution, I aimed to build simple
abstractions that fit the project at hand.

## Heading 2

Given the freedom of a solo project with flexible deadlines, I've pushed this pretty far, building a
lot of stuff that I might otherwise not need to, such as simple content editing and authentication
systems.

### Heading 3

In trying to merge 2 projects, I ended up with the worst of both works — I build & maintain that
piece of my solution.
