I've got a new blog! Although I've had a few blogs over the years, I've never been particularly
persistent at actually writing in them, and I've had the sminn.ee domain for probably a decade,
thinking “I should really set up a blog there at some stage”, without having doing it.

When I was CEO at Silverstripe, “you should start a CEO blog” was something that I agreed to, and
failed to follow through on, so many times that it become a running joke at the management team.

But, it's 2023, people are getting tired social media, what better time to start a new blog?

My main motivation for starting a blog is simple: to build a habit of putting my thoughts in
writing. I was inspired by my friend Ingo’s motivation to get better about remembering things that
he had read each week. He shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2ZJiIt4pmo">this YouTube
video of tips</a>. A couple of those suggested that sharing ideas, teaching ideas to others, and
writing them down helped with retention.

My plan is to post each Sunday, capturing something that I learned from the week prior. We'll see
where this leads, and you're welcome to join me on the journey. Hopefully some of what I write is
useful to others, and failing that it will at least help me clarify my thniking.
